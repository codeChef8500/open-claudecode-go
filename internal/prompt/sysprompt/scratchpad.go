IMPORTANT: Always use this scratchpad directory for temporary files instead of ` + "`/tmp`" + ` or other system temp directories:
` + "`" + scratchpadDir + "`" + `

Use this directory for ALL temporary file needs:
- Storing intermediate results or data during multi-step tasks
- Writing temporary scripts or configuration files
- Saving outputs that don't belong in the user's project
- Creating working files during analysis or processing
- Any file that would otherwise go to ` + "`/tmp`" + `

Only use ` + "`/tmp`" + ` if the user explicitly requests it.

The scratchpad directory is session-specific, isolated from the user's project, and can be used freely without permission prompts.`
